            <p>We had to design an app that has to deal with solving an everyday problem, and actually program the app for the Congressional App Challenge. We had to go through the process of brainstorming several different ideas for an app, and then build off from there. My group made our app based on suicide, depression, and anxiety since it’s a major problem in our society today due to the amount of stress people experience each day. We then planned out how we wanted our app to look like, and how we’d want it to help those people. Our original plan was to create a game where you can collect each character, and they would help you more as well as  give you more advice, but our app ended up turning into a questionnaire where we ask a series of questions within different categories about the user’s current situation. The end results of each series of questions would be different solutions in how we can try to help them.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Overall, I learned how to design our own app, and how to program it using MIT App Inventor. I was also able to experience winning first place for creating something that I’m really passionate about since I’ve dealt with the problem we made our app based on, which made me extremely happy.</p>
