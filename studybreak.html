            <p>For our Winter PBL, we had to create an app that we could teach middle and elementary schoolers how to make. My group made an app called “Study Break” which is just as the title says: it is for those who have been studying for a while, but decide to take a break from it. We added in different ways of how you can take a break from studying such as exercising or making yourself a snack. You can also track your goals, and use the timer to give yourself a time limit for your little break. </p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>I got to use MIT App Inventor for the first time, so it was a bit confusing to me at first but I eventually understood how it works after playing around with it. I also was able to learn more about creating an app since with the previous app I didn’t really deal with the programming of the app since I was more focused on content and design at the time, but this time I was able to help my group with both designing it as well as programming it. Although it may be quite simple or basic, I think our app turned out really nice even though it was my first time using App Inventor.</p>
