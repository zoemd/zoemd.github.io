            <p>We had to work with our groups to design consistent website mockups and animated banner advertisements for our design firm while following the firm’s mission statement. I was in the company called “Aesthete”, which emphasizes the whole aesthetic aspect of design by creating simplicity. When we were creating the mockups, we had to use InDesign, which was quite new to us, so we were encouraged to learn more about that while designing our web mockups. Along with that, we had to learn how to animate a banner ad using a program we already know about, which was photoshop.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Within this project, I mainly learned how to use InDesign a lot more efficiently compared to when we first opened the program. I found it to be a more simple and organized way of creating mockups for web. I was able to create my own template by designing a master page and basing the other pages off of that, along with using tools such as paragraph styles to speed up the process a bit.</p>
