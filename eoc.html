            <p>We had to create a website for two clients regarding the End of Course exams. We were to follow the same process when building a website, which would be to start off with gathering content, planning the whole design out, then actually creating it. We used WordPress when making this website, which was fairly new to us at the time since we were used to just using HTML and CSS.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>During this project, I learned to better communicate and work together with a group. I also gained new knowledge from using WordPress for our website considering it was something that we had to learn while creating this site.</p>
