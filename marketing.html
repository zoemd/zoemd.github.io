		<p>In Business Software Applications we had to start our own company, and create a marketing campaign for an app that we chose. We had to think of our own logos and company names, so my group ended up being called “KAAZ Division” which is just a combination of our first name initials. My group chose a card making app called “Paperless Post”, and we had to create our own marketing campaigns promoting that app.</p>

            <br>
            
            <p>I learned more about what it would be like if you worked for a marketing company during this project. I learned about the different ways you can create a marketing campaign on something individually, while also receiving input from other members of the same company, and from those in different companies.</p>
