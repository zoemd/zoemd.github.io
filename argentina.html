            <p>We worked together with Spanish class to create a travel website about our assigned countries. My group created a site for Argentina where we included the Spanish advertisements that we made in Graphic Design, and applied our knowledge we learned throughout the school year in creating websites. We went through the process we were taught to go through when making a site which was starting off with a wireframe, moodboard, mockup, then coding the actual website.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>I learned to communicate and collaborate more with my group because we had to split the work up, but make sure everything would still go well together. I was in charge of coding the HTML, and that wasnâ€™t as much of a problem as coding the CSS, which we ended up having to work on together a lot because we got confused about it, but in the end we were able to (somewhat) successfully create a full website.</p>
