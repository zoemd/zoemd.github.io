            <p>We had to create our own videos individually on what exactly we want to be remembered for, why we want to be remembered for it, and how we think people will remember us. I actually wanted to be remembered for bringing positivity, and helping people cheer up because I wasn’t much of a positive person at the time, so I wanted to be able to help people. I ended up just making mine a video on me drawing and writing about what I wanted to be remembered for.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>I actually learned a bit more about myself during this project because it really made me think about what exactly I wanted to be remembered for, and I didn’t think I’d end up wanting to be remembered for spreading positivity considering I’m such a negative person to begin with. Overall, this was actually quite a nice project since it was different from the others because this was more based on yourself.</p>
